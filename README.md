## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each of the website's pages depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each page and be able to toggle between the tabs to see new information


## My process

My process was just try out whatever seemed to work. Analyze it, think about it, come up with a solution and do it. If it works then don't touch it. If it doesn't stackoverflow it.

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

Even if it doesn't seem possible at the beginning, it can be done eventually. You just have to do it.
No matter how daunting the task, it can be done.
Although, this is not what I think I am supposed to write in this


### Continued development

Definitely, do want to focus on linking between pages and how to make it more effecient.
Also, since I couldn't figure out how to create active state, I want to work on that too. The problem with this is probably that I created individual pages.


### Improvement

This is basically what I think can improve this website even more.
- Actually going through the process of booking a flight
- Emphasizing more on the trip
  1. More info about the planet
  2. The "hotel", visitors/guest will be staying at
  3. The insides of the spaceship
- Login/SignUp
- Payment process
